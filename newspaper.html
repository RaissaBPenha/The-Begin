 <p>The release of Bennett Miller's "Capote" has given Film Forum an excuse to screen a new print of Richard Brooks's "In Cold Blood." That movie, released in 1967 -- remarkably soon after the publication of Truman Capote's book and the execution of its two main characters -- is well worth revisiting. Filmed in some of the places in Kansas where the events depicted actually happened (including the penitentiary where Perry Smith and Dick Hickock were executed and the house where their victims lived and died), "In Cold Blood" is a potent and atmospheric example of noir-tinged naturalism. Conrad Hall's black-and-white cinematography takes us into a shadowy world of irrational evil, while Quincy Jones's score provides a hint of human warmth to the bleak landscape. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake (above right, with Mr. Wilson) play the killers, and John Forsythe plays Alvin Dewey, the investigator played by Chris Cooper in "Capote." Together, the movies, separated by almost 40 years, offer some intriguing meshes and contrasts. In some ways, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Capote provides the piece of "In Cold Blood" that has always been missing, but "In Cold Blood," on the screen and on the page, remains terrifyingly complete and coherent unto itself.
